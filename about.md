Hey, I'm Kyle!  Welcome to my site.

I'm a statistician + data scientist on the Research Team at [CDK Global](http://www.cdkglobal.com/) in Seattle.  My work involves solving business problems with statistics, and writing software to automate my solutions (and eventually replace myself).  My projects cover a variety of topics, including time series forecasting, outlier detection, semi-supervised learning, and AB testing. 

I graduated in 2015 with an MS in Statistics from the [University of Washington](https://www.stat.washington.edu/). Before that, I spent some time as a research assistant at the [Institute of Mathematics - Academia Sinica](http://www.math.sinica.edu.tw/www/default_e.jsp) in Taipei.

You can find some of my work on [Github](https://github.com/kyleclo).

I also jointly run a [working group](https://solstat.github.io/) with some of my friends from the UW Statistics department.  We're currently interested in reinforcement learning, and you can find some of our work on [Github](https://github.com/solstat) as well. 

Feel free to contact me at kyleclo-at-uw-dot-edu or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kylelo).
