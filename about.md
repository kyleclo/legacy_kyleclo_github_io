Welcome to my site!

I'm a statistician / data scientist on the Research Team at [CDK Global](http://www.cdkglobal.com/) in Seattle.  My work involves designing and writing software applications that apply statistical & machine learning methods to solve business problems.  My projects cover a variety of topics, including time series forecasting, classification, and AB testing. 

I graduated in 2015 with an MS in Statistics from the [University of Washington](https://www.stat.washington.edu/). Before that, I spent some time as a research assistant at the [Institute of Mathematics - Academia Sinica](http://www.math.sinica.edu.tw/www/default_e.jsp) in Taipei.

You can find examples of some of my work on [Github](https://github.com/kyleclo).

I also jointly run a [working group](https://solstat.github.io/) with some of my friends from the UW Statistics department.  We're currently interested in reinforcement learning and bandit problems, and you can find some of our code on [Github](https://github.com/solstat). 

Outside of work, I like playing tennis, watching movies, and playing video/tabletop games.
