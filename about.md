Kyle is a Statistician + Data Scientist + Software Engineer on the Research Team at [CDK Global](http://www.cdkglobal.com/) in Seattle.  He is often seen reading or muttering to himself in front of a whiteboard, but occasionally he builds something useful. 

He graduated in 2015 with an MS in Statistics from the [University of Washington](https://www.stat.washington.edu/). Before that, he spent some time as a Research Assistant at the [Institute of Mathematics - Academia Sinica](http://www.math.sinica.edu.tw/www/default_e.jsp) in Taipei.

Some of his less secretive work can be found on [Github](https://github.com/kyleclo).

He also jointly runs a [working group](https://solstat.github.io/) with some UW Statistics students.
